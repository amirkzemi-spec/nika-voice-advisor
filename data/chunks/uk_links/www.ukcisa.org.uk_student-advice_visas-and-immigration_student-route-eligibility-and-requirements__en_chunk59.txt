Using your partner's funds If your partner is applying for immigration permission at the same time as you, the evidence of the funds used in your Student route application can be in your partner’s sole name.
This applies regardless of whether or not you and your partner are making an entry clearance application or a permission to stay application.
Alternatively, the evidence of funds used in your Student route application can be in your partner’s name only, if your partner already has some form of immigration permission.
The Immigration Rules do not specify what type of immigration permission your partner has to have.
