Digital passport check In some cases, the Swedish Migration Agency will notify you that you must present your passport for a digital passport check via an app.
If you are granted a residence permit, you will be fingerprinted and photographed at one of the Swedish Migration Agency’s service centres once you have arrived in Sweden.
If you present your passport digitally, but have also been called in for an interview, you need to book an appointment to visit an embassy or consulate-general.
During this visit, you may also need to provide fingerprints and have your picture taken.
