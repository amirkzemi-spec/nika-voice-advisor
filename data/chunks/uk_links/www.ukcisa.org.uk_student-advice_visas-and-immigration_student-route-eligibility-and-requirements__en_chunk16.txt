Pre-sessional courses A pre-sessional course prepares you for your main course of study.
It doesn’t need to lead to an approved qualification, but it must be at the same minimal level as courses below degree-level or English language courses.
English language courses English language courses must involve at least 15 hours a week of organised daytime study and lead to an approved qualification at level B2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
If you are 16 or 17 years old and you want to study an English language course, you must apply for the Student route, or a Short-term student visa if your course is between six to 11 months.
