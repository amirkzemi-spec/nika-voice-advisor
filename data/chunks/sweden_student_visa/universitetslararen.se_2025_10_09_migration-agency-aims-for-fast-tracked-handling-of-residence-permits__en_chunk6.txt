Doctoral students’ residence permits are valid for a maximum of four years, which means that they need to apply for an extension if their thesis defence is delayed or if their studies have been interrupted, for example because of teaching commitments, parental leave or illness.
If the original permit expires before an extension has been granted, the doctoral student is effectively stuck in the country and unable to participate in conferences or other research-related activities abroad, Andersson tells us.
