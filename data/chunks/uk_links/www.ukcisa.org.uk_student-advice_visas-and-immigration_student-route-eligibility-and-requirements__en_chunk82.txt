On Student route applications for study at postgraduate level and above, there are no longer any time limits.
Time limits and Coronavirus (Covid-19) The Covid-19: Guidance for Student sponsors, migrants and for Short-term students confirms that the time limits for those studying courses at degree-level and below degree-level, will remain the same.
Discretion may be applied in the future by the Home Office if the length of time granted to you under the Student route would take you over the time limit as a result of Covid-19.
