For study elsewhere in the UK, the monthly amounts are lower: you will need £1,171 for each month of your course, and up to £10,539 for a course lasting nine months or more.
Use the course start and end dates on your CAS to calculate the length of your course and therefore how many months' maintenance you will need.
If the length of your course includes a part of a month, round it up to a full month.
For example, if your course dates are 30 May-1 October, this is four months and two days so you would need to show five months of funds.
