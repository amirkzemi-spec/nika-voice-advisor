The guidance for permission to stay applications summarises that Home Office staff should be checking applications for: “...evidence of any adverse behaviour (using deception including false representation, fraud, forgery, non-disclosure of material facts or failure to cooperate) character, conduct or associations (criminal history, deportation order, travel ban, exclusion, non-conducive to public good, national security) immigration history (breaching conditions, using deception in an application).” The Home Office can also refuse your application if you have an outstanding debt for NHS treatment of £500 or more - see Healthcare for information about receiving NHS treatment in the UK.
