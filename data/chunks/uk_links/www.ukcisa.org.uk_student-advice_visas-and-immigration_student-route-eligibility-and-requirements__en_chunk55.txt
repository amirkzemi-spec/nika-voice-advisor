Business accounts are not acceptable because the Immigration Rules ( Appendix Finance ) specify that accounts must be personal.
If you wish to use a personal bank account in your parent's or guardian's name (or names), you must include evidence of their relationship to you.
This evidence of your relationship with your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can be proven with: Your birth certificate, or a copy, showing the name of your parent(s) whose bank account you are using for your immigration application.
If you are adopted, the certificate of adoption, or a copy, showing your name and the name of your parent(s) whose bank account you are using for your immigration application.
