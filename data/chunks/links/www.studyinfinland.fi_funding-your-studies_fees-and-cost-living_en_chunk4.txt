Students may also find internships related to their field.
However, finding employment during your studies can be quite challenging, especially without Finnish/Swedish skills.
What's more, possible part-time job salaries would not be sufficient to cover both tuition and living costs.
So you should not base your financial plans on the uncertain prospect of finding part-time employment during your studies.
Student Union Fees University students pay an annual student union fee of about €50-€70 per academic year, granting access to discounts in student restaurants and public transport.
Student union membership at universities of applied sciences (UAS) is optional.
