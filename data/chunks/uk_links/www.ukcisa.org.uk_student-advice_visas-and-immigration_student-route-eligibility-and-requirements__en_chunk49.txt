A letter from your bank or financial institution will normally confirm the balance and the length of time that this balance has been held.
As with a personal bank statement, the required funds must not have fallen below the required amount for a consecutive 28-day period.
The letter must also not be dated any later than 31 days after the date of your application.
Please note, if you are relying on using funds from a joint account, the letter must include your name together with the name of the other account holder.
