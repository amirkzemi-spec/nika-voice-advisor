Seek help and advice from your Student sponsor before you make your application if you think any of the general grounds for refusal might apply to you.
Time limits Last updated 21 February, 2025 There are time limits, or ‘caps’, on how long you can study with the Student route.
Before a Student sponsor issues your Confirmation of Acceptance of Studies (CAS), they will check that your proposed studies will not take you over the time limit.
When assessing your application, the Home Office will also check that you will not exceed the time limit, unless there are "compelling and compassionate circumstances", such as injury or disability.
