UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) say that your passport must remain valid for the full length of your stay, but this has no basis in any law or guidance and we do not know of any student who has been refused entry to the UK on this basis.
It would be very common for someone's passport to expire during a long stay in the UK.
If you are applying for entry clearance and your passport will expire very shortly after you arrive in the UK, it is advisable to renew it before you make your Student application , if there is time to do so.
