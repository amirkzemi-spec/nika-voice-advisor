Share How to Apply for a scholarship? Each university has its own scholarship options and application process.
In some programmes, you can apply for a scholarship at the same time as you submit your admission application — making it easy to plan your studies and funding together.
In other cases, scholarships become available after you’ve started your studies.
These may reward your progress, academic success, or even your growing Finnish language skills.
Scholarships and tuition fee waivers may assist you in covering your tuition fees, however, you must independently cover your own living costs .
