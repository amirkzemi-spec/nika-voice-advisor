The printouts must clearly show your name, the title and date of the award, and the name of the awarding body.
If you submit a printout of your qualification or transcript, the Home Office reserves the right to request the certificate of qualification, or transcript of results.
If you submit any certificates or transcripts that are not in English or Welsh, you must also include a translation of each.
‘Low-risk’ applicants do not need to submit these documents but should have them available in case the Home Office asks to see them.
