This is because the Immigration Rules include provision to refuse the application of someone with certain criminal convictions, under the general grounds for refusal (see next section).
You are not required to obtain or include any specific evidence relating to the convictions.
For further details about the types of convictions that you must declare, see the Home Office document Naturalisation as a British citizen - a guide for applicants .
This guidance is aimed at those applying for British nationality, but the information about criminal convictions is relevant to those applying for either a visa or permission.
