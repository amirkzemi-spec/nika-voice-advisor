Fees and Cost of Living


Quality education is a valuable investment. Prepare to finance your studies by paying the tuition fees and cover your everyday living costs. As they say, good things are worth the price!

Tuition Fees
Non-EU/EEA students need to pay tuition for English-taught bachelor’s and master’s programmes.
Fees range from €8,000 to €20,000 per year, varying by university and programme. Check specific fees on 
Studyinfo.fi
 or with the university you are applying to. If you are paying tuition, you are often also eligible to apply for the 
possible scholarships offered by the university in question
.
Doctoral programmes do not charge tuition, regardless of nationality. 
Living Expenses
Beyond tuition, you need to be able to cover your living costs independently.
Finland is a relatively expensive country to live in, so while the official minimum requirement set by Finnish Immigration Service Migri is €800 per month, we recommend you reserve a bit more for your living expenses, approximately €900 – €1000 per month. This includes food, 
accommodation
, and travel.
You must prove 
sufficient finances
 and 
insurance
 when applying for a 
student residence permit
.
Is it possible to work part-time during studies?
International students are allowed to work part-time up to 30 hours per week on average during the academic year and full-time during holidays. Students may also find internships related to their field.
However, finding employment during your studies can be quite challenging, especially without Finnish/Swedish skills. What's more, possible part-time job salaries would not be sufficient to cover both tuition and living costs.
So you should not base your financial plans on the uncertain prospect of finding part-time employment during your studies.
Student Union Fees
University students pay an annual student union fee of about €50-€70 per academic year, granting access to discounts in student restaurants and public transport. Student union membership at universities of applied sciences (UAS) is optional.
Your Finnish university can provide advice on student union and health care fees, among other practicalities.
Student Healthcare Fee
If you are studying for a bachelor's or a master's degree: in order to use the services of the 
Finnish Student Health Service FSHS
, you'll be required to pay an annual 
student healthcare fee
 - currently around 35 euros per term (that's about 70 euros per year).
