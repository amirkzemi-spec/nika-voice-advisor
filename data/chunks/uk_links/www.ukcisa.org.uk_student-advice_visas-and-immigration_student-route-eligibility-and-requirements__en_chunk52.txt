Loans If you are applying for your visa outside of the UK, the loan must be available to you before you travel to the UK, unless it is a loan from your country's national government, in which case it must be made available to you before you begin your course.
Alternatively, the funds must be paid directly to your Student sponsor before you travel to the UK.
In this case, the living costs part of the loan must be made available to you by the time you arrive in the UK.
Any other type of loan will not meet the Student route requirements.
