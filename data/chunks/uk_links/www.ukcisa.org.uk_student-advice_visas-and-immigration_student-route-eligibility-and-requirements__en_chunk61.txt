Although relying on funds in your partner's name is permitted under the Immigration Rules, reports suggest that this is not reflected in any of the options when completing the Student route application form itself and that the only options in which to select are that the funds are in your name or the name of your parent(s).
If this is the case and you wish to rely on funds in your partner's name, you may wish to add a note in the free text section of the application form, correctly stating that you are relying on funds in your partner's name.
