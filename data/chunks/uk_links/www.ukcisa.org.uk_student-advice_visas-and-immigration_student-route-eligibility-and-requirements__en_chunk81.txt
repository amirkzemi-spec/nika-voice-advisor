Student permission you had before your 18th birthday will not be counted.
In most cases, this limit is five years.
However, for students studying at a higher education provider with a track record of compliance, this may be increased to five years and 11 months.
Some courses are exempt from the five-year limit when you apply under the Student route to study them, including medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, architecture and some legal qualifications.
If you later make another application to study a different course, the time you were granted to study these usually exempt courses will be counted.
