You can apply for the Student route if you’re 16 or over and want to study on an eligible course (further education, higher education, pre-sessional English course, a recognised foundation programme) or as a students’ union sabbatical officer at an educational provider in the UK, who is a Student sponsor.
Before you apply for the Student route, you must have applied and been accepted to your chosen course at an education provider in the UK.
Once you have been accepted, you will receive an electronic document called a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS), which you must use in your application.
