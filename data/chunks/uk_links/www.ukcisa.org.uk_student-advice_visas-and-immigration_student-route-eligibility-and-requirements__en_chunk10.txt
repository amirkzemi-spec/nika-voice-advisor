Your application may be refused if there are any discrepancies between the information used by your institution to generate the CAS and the information on your application form, so contact your Student sponsor before you apply if you notice any details on your CAS which are incorrect.
You may obtain a CAS from several different institutions.
However, before you apply for the Student route, you must decide where you intend to study and use the CAS from that institution in your application.
At this point, any other CAS that you have been issued with will be obsolete, and you will not be able to use this in a Student route application.
