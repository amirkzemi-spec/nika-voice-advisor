Deductions You can deduct the following from the total amount of money that you need as part of your immigration application: money that you have already paid to your Student sponsor towards your course fees, and up to £1,529 that you have already paid to your Student sponsor for your accommodation fees, if you will be living in university or college accommodation.
You cannot deduct any advance payment for any other type of housing, nor can you adjust the amounts if you will have no housing costs (for example, if you will be living with a relative free of charge).
Your CAS may include details of any money paid to your institution.
