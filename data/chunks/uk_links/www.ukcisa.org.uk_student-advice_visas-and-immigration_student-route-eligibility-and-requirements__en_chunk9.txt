Your Student sponsor will send you a unique CAS reference number, which you will need to enter on your online Student route application.
Your Student sponsor should also provide you with the information used to generate your CAS, usually called the 'CAS statement'.
The CAS statement itself is not required for your Student route application, but it has useful information about your course and Student sponsor, and some information about money, which will help you to complete your Student route application.
