Other general grounds for refusal include: Staying in the UK beyond the end of your immigration permission (being an overstayer).
Not attending an interview if you are asked to do so.
Breach of conditions , which means doing something your immigration permission does not permit you to do, for example working more hours than allowed.
The Student route application has questions about these matters and it is very important to answer them honestly, as not doing so can have very serious consequences, including accusations of deception and the refusal of your application and any future application you want to make.
