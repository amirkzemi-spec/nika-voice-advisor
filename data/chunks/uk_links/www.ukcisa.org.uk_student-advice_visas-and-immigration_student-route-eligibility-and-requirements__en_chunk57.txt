If any other relative or unrelated person wishes to support you financially with your Student route application, the financial evidence (such as a bank statement) must be in joint names.
Alternatively, the money can be held in your partner’s name.
If you do not have any of the above, but you have a government-issued household register showing your name and your parent or parents' name(s), the Home Office's financial requirement casework guidance confirms that this is acceptable evidence of your relationship, though this option is not listed on the application form.
