Part-time postgraduate courses Higher education providers (with a track record of compliance) may sponsor part-time postgraduate study which leads to an approved qualification at RQF level 7 or SCQF level 11 or above.
Students on the Student route studying part-time are subject to certain restrictions: no work, no work placements, no dependants.
Study abroad Study abroad means you are currently studying a course outside the UK which is equivalent to a UK degree and as part of that course, you come to the UK for a short period of full-time study.
