go 2025/10/01 14:01 How about speed up absurd waiting time for permanent residency for PhDs if Sweden values them so much? Waiting time is now 8 months, while for work permits it's 1 month! And this waiting time is a gamble on when they open your case and whether there's enough time remaining in your contract.
