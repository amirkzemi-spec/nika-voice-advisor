The Immigration Rules make it clear that the whole duration of your stay in the UK while on the Student route is counted, including: Extra periods of time added to your Student visa or permission before and after your course.
Any holidays or vacations.
Time spent outside of the UK.
Any time spent not studying.
Any time spent on a different level of course.
Any time previously spent studying on the Student route (including on Tier 4).
The Home Office's Student and Child Student guidance confirms that if your Student visa or permission is cancelled (formerly known as curtailed), only the period before the new expiry date is counted.
