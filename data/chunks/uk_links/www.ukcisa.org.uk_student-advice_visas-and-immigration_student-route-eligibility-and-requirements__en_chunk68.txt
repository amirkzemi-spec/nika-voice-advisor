You can also find out if you need an ATAS clearance certificate or whether you are exempt because of your nationality.
Your institution must confirm on your CAS whether you require an ATAS clearance certificate.
If you do, you must apply to the FCDO and obtain your ATAS clearance certificate before you submit your Student route application.
When your ATAS clearance certificate is issued, it is valid for six months to use in a Student route application.
Once you have used it in your application, it gives you security clearance for the whole proposed period of study on your CAS.
