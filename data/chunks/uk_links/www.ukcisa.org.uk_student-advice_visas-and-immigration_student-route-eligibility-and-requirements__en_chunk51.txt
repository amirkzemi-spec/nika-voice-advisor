For example, there is no maximum time limit on how long you have held the funds, and a certificate is acceptable even if it has wording that says the funds are 'frozen' or 'inaccessible'.
Please refer to the sections on using your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) funds, and using your partner’s funds, if the Certificate of deposit is in either of these individuals' names for the details of the additional evidence that you will be required to submit.
