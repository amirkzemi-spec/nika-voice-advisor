If your official financial sponsor is a government and they have sent you a sponsor letter by email, a printout of this letter should be acceptable as evidence of the sponsorship.
The entry clearance officer can still ask for an original letter, so it is a good idea to ask your government sponsor for a paper copy too.
The list of acceptable official financial sponsors includes an 'international company'.
The Home Office has not defined this, but this means a company with a trading presence (an office) in more than one country.
If your official financial sponsor is not covering all of your course fees and maintenance, you must show that you have the rest of the money required.
